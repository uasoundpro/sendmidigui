# Revisions & Changes

This document outlines the key functional and structural changes made to the `SendMidiGui` application.

## VERSION 2.0.1
DATE: 2025-10-27

### I. Hybrid Mode Control

| Feature | Change Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manual CH1 Reroute Override** | Added a global state (`ch1_override_active`) and a new **checkbox** ("Force CH1 Reroute (Hybrid)") in the main GUI. This checkbox state is saved to `config.json` and its visual appearance (color, enabled/disabled state) updates based on the current mode and whether it's checked. | Allows the user to manually force MIDI Channel 1 messages to be rerouted to the Channel 2 device (e.g., MC8) **only when in Hybrid mode**, even if the primary Channel 1 device (e.g., Quad Cortex) is connected. Provides granular control over Hybrid mode routing and clear visual feedback. |

## VERSION 2.0.x
DATE: 2025-10-26

This version represents a major architectural overhaul, refactoring the original monolithic script into a modular, class-based application for improved maintainability, readability, and stability.

## I. Major Refactoring and Code Structure

These changes fundamentally alter how the application is organized and managed.

| Feature | Change Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Modular Codebase** | Split the single `SendMidiGui.py` file into multiple, dedicated files (`main.py`, `config.py`, `utils.py`, `midi_manager.py`) and a `gui` package (`gui/app.py`, `gui/popups.py`). | Dramatically improved **readability**, **maintainability**, and **testability**. Makes it easier to locate and modify specific parts of the application without affecting others. ‚ú® |
| **Class-Based Architecture** | Introduced `MidiManager` class to encapsulate all MIDI device interaction, process management (sendmidi/receivemidi), and monitoring logic. Introduced `MidiSenderApp` class to manage the main GUI state and lifecycle. | Replaced heavy reliance on **global variables** with instance attributes, leading to better state management and reduced potential for conflicts. Clearer separation of backend logic and frontend presentation. üèóÔ∏è |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Isolated configuration constants and paths (`config.py`), non-GUI helper functions (`utils.py`), MIDI backend logic (`midi_manager.py`), startup GUI prompts (`gui/popups.py`), and the main application window (`gui/app.py`). | Enhances code organization, making the project easier to understand, debug, and extend. |
| **Refined Startup Process** | Centralized application entry point in `main.py`. Moved initial setlist and device selection into popups managed by `gui/popups.py`, which run before the main `MidiSenderApp` GUI is fully initialized and shown. | Provides a cleaner, more controlled application launch sequence. Handles relaunch logic (e.g., after monitor fail) more explicitly. üöÄ |

## II. GUI and User Experience

Improvements focused on visual feedback and interaction stability.

| Feature | Change Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MIDI Activity Toasts** | Added short-duration (250ms), yellow toast notifications in the **top-right corner** indicating "SENDING" or "RECEIVING" MIDI data activity. | Provides immediate, non-intrusive visual feedback when MIDI operations occur. üö¶ |
| **Thread-Safe GUI Updates** | Modified the `show_toast` function to ensure all GUI updates are safely executed on the main Tkinter thread, even when triggered from background threads (MIDI sending/monitoring). | Ensures GUI stability during MIDI operations. üëç |
| **Corrected Toast Placement & Visibility** | Adjusted toast message placement logic to ensure visibility in the intended top-right location above other elements. | Improves the usability of the MIDI activity feedback. ‚úÖ |

## VERSION 1.1.x
DATE: 2025-10-25

## I. USB Lock and Monitoring Reliability

These changes directly address the core issue of continuous monitoring and user control over automatic switching.

| Feature | Change Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **USB Failover Lock** | Added a global state (`usb_lock_active`) and a new **checkbox** in the main GUI to **activate** or **deactivate** the lock. | Allows the user to prevent the automatic failover (USB to BT) and failback (BT to USB) prompts from appearing, keeping the session uninterrupted while still **monitoring** the USB devices. |
| **Continuous Monitoring Fix** | Restructured the `monitor_midi_device` logic to ensure the `root.after(5000, monitor_midi_device)` call executes **every time** at the end of the function, unless a full
